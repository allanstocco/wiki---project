# Django







Django is a web framework written using [Python](/wiki/Python) that allows for the design of web applications that generate [HTML](/wiki/HTML) dynamically.





Django is a Python-based free and open-source web framework that follows the model template views (MTV) architectural pattern. It is maintained by the Django Software Foundation (DSF), an American independent organization established as a 501 non-profit.



Django's primary goal is to ease the creation of complex, database-driven websites. The framework emphasizes reusability and "pluggability" of components, less code, low coupling, rapid development, and the principle of don't repeat yourself. Python is used throughout, even for settings, files, and data models. Django also provides an optional administrative create, read, update and delete interface that is generated dynamically through introspection and configured via admin models.



Some well-known sites that use Django include Instagram, Mozilla, Disqus, Bitbucket, Nextdoor and Clubhouse.
